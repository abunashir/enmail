= GPGME Adapter Guide

`GPGME` adapter provides OpenPGP-compliant cryptography via
https://gnupg.org/software/gpgme/index.html[GnuPG Made Easy] library.

== Dependencies

This adapter requries two additional pieces of software to be installed:

1. GnuPG, version 2.2
2. `https://rubygems.org/gems/gpgme[gpgme]` gem

== Options

Following adapter-specific options are supported:

`signer`::
Optional.  User id or e-mail which identifies key which will be used for message
signing.  By default, first address from mail's From field is used.
`key_password`::
Optional.  Password for signer's key.  Must be a string.

== Caveats

If you want to use home directory in a non-standard location, change it for
whole GPGME in following way: `GPGME::Engine.home_dir = 'path/to/home_dir'`
